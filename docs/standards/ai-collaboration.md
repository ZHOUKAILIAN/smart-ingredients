## When to Use `CLAUDE.md`

Use `CLAUDE.md` when you need an AI assistant to understand project context, conventions, or current priorities.

## When to Use `AGENTS.md`

Use `AGENTS.md` when coordinating multi-agent workflows or enforcing process rules (e.g., docs-first, plan/execute/verify).

## Maintenance
